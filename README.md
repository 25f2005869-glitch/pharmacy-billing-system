# # # 💊 Pharmacy Billing System

A beginner-friendly Python mini project that simulates a real-world pharmacy billing process with loyalty points and redemption logic.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is designed to practice basic Python programming concepts by building a simple billing system used in medical stores.

It calculates medicine bills, assigns loyalty points based on purchase amount, and allows customers to redeem points in future visits.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Simulate real pharmacy billing system
- Practice Python loops & conditionals
- Implement business logic
- Handle user input
- Build a beginner portfolio project

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- Loops (for loop, nested loops)
- Conditional statements (if-else)
- User input handling
- Arithmetic operations
- Basic business logic implementation

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Multiple customer visits support  
- Multiple medicine types per visit  
- Automatic bill calculation  
- Loyalty points earning system  
- Points redemption option  
- Discount calculation  
- Basic input validation  

---

## 🎁 Loyalty Points Logic

| Bill Amount | Points Earned |
|------------|---------------|
| ₹100 spent | 1 point |

---

## 💸 Redemption Rules

- 1 point = ₹25 discount  
- Minimum 10 points required  
- Redemption limited to bill amount  
- Cannot redeem more than available points
